	abstract =	{This document defines a mobility extension to the Host Identity Protocol (HIP). Specifically, this document defines a "LOCATOR\_SET" parameter for HIP messages that allows for a HIP host to notify peers about alternate addresses at which it may be reached. This document also defines how the parameter can be used to preserve communications across a change to the IP address used by one or both peer hosts. The same LOCATOR\_SET parameter can also be used to support end-host multihoming (as specified in RFC 8047). This document obsoletes RFC 5206.},
