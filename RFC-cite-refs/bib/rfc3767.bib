	abstract =	{This document describes a protocol whereby a user can acquire cryptographic credentials (e.g., private keys, PKCS \#15 structures) from a credential server, using a workstation that has locally trusted software installed, but with no user-specific configuration. The protocol's payloads are described in XML. This memo also specifies a Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) profile of the protocol. Security requirements are met by mandating support for TLS and/or DIGEST-MD5 (through BEEP). {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
