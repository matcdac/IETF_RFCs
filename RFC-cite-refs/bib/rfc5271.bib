	abstract =	{Mobile IPv6 is designed to maintain its connectivity while moving from one network to another. It is adopted in 3G CDMA networks as a way to maintain connectivity when the mobile node (MN) moves between access routers. However, this handover procedure requires not only movement detection by the MN, but also the acquisition of a new Care-of Address and Mobile IPv6 registration with the new care-of address before the traffic can be sent or received in the target network. During this period, packets destined for the mobile node may be lost, which may not be acceptable for a real-time application such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or video telephony. This document specifies fast handover methods in the 3G CDMA networks in order to reduce latency and packet loss during handover. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
