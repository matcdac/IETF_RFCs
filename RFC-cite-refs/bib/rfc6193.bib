	abstract =	{This document specifies how to establish a media session that represents a virtual private network using the Session Initiation Protocol for the purpose of on-demand media/application sharing between peers. It extends the protocol identifier of the Session Description Protocol (SDP) so that it can negotiate use of the Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE) for media sessions in the SDP offer/answer model. It also specifies a method to boot up IKE and generate IPsec security associations using a self-signed certificate. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.},
