	abstract =	{This document specifies a real-time transport protocol (RTP) payload format to be used for Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) and Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB) encoded speech signals. The payload format is designed to be able to interoperate with existing AMR and AMR-WB transport formats on non-IP networks. In addition, a file format is specified for transport of AMR and AMR-WB speech data in storage mode applications such as email. Two separate MIME type registrations are included, one for AMR and one for AMR-WB, specifying use of both the RTP payload format and the storage format. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
