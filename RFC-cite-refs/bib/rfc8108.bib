	abstract =	{This memo expands and clarifies the behavior of Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) endpoints that use multiple synchronization sources (SSRCs). This occurs, for example, when an endpoint sends multiple RTP streams in a single RTP session. This memo updates RFC 3550 with regard to handling multiple SSRCs per endpoint in RTP sessions, with a particular focus on RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) behavior. It also updates RFC 4585 to change and clarify the calculation of the timeout of SSRCs and the inclusion of feedback messages.},
