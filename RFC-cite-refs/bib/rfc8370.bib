	abstract =	{Networks that utilize RSVP-TE LSPs are encountering implementations that have a limited ability to support the growth in the number of LSPs deployed. This document defines two techniques, Refresh-Interval Independent RSVP (RI-RSVP) and Per-Peer Flow Control, that reduce the number of processing cycles required to maintain RSVP-TE LSP state in Label Switching Routers (LSRs) and hence allow implementations to support larger scale deployments.},
