	abstract =	{The Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol (ICCP) supports an inter-chassis redundancy mechanism that is used to support high network availability. In this document, Provider Edge (PE) devices in a Redundancy Group (RG) running ICCP are used to offer multihomed connectivity to Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) networks to improve availability of the STP networks. The ICCP TLVs and usage for the ICCP STP application are defined.},
