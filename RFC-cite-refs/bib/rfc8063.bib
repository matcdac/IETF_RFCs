	abstract =	{This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) mapping for a key relay object that relays DNSSEC key material between EPP clients using the poll queue defined in RFC 5730. This key relay mapping will help facilitate changing the DNS operator of a domain while keeping the DNSSEC chain of trust intact.},
