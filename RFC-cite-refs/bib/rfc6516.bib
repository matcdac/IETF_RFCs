	abstract =	{The specification for Multicast Virtual Private Networks (MVPNs) contains an option that allows the use of PIM as the control protocol between provider edge routers. It also contains an option that allows UDP-based messages, known as Selective Provider Multicast Service Interface (S-PMSI) Join messages, to be used to bind particular customer multicast flows to particular tunnels through a service provider's network. This document extends the MVPN specification (RFC 6513) so that these options can be used when the customer multicast flows are IPv6 flows. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
