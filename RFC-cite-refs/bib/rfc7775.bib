	abstract =	{In existing specifications, the route preferences for IPv4/IPv6 Extended Reachability TLVs are not explicitly stated. There are also inconsistencies in the definition of how the up/down bit applies to route preference when the prefix advertisement appears in Level 2 Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs). This document addresses these issues.},
