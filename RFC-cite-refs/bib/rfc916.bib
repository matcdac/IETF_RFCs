	abstract =	{This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. This paper proposes and specifies a protocol which allows two programs to reliably communicate over a communication link. It ensures that the data entering one end of the link if received arrives at the other end intact and unaltered. The protocol, named RATP, is designed to operate over a full duplex point-to-point connection. It contains some features which tailor it to the RS-232 links now in common use.},
