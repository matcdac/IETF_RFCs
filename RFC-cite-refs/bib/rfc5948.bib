	abstract =	{IEEE 802.16 is an air interface specification for wireless broadband access. IEEE 802.16 has specified multiple service-specific Convergence Sublayers for transmitting upper-layer protocols. The Packet CS (Packet Convergence Sublayer) is used for the transport of all packet-based protocols such as the Internet Protocol (IP) and IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet). The IP-specific part of the Packet CS enables the transport of IPv4 packets directly over the IEEE 802.16 Media Access Control (MAC) layer. This document specifies the frame format, the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), and the address assignment procedures for transmitting IPv4 packets over the IP-specific part of the Packet Convergence Sublayer of IEEE 802.16. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
