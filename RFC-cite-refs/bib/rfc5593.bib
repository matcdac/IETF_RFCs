	abstract =	{The existing IMAP URL specification (RFC 5092) lists several \textless{}access\textgreater{} identifiers and \textless{}access\textgreater{} identifier prefixes that can be used to restrict access to URLAUTH-generated URLs. However, these identifiers do not provide facilities for new services such as streaming. This document proposes a set of new \textless{}access\textgreater{} identifiers as well as an IANA mechanism to register new \textless{}access\textgreater{} identifiers for future applications. This document updates RFC 5092. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
