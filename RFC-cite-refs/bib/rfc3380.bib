	abstract =	{This document specifies 3 additional OPTIONAL operations for use with the Internet Printing Protocol/1.0 (IPP) {[}RFC2565, RFC2566{]}, and IPP/1.1 {[}RFC2911, RFC2910{]}. The end user, operator, and administrator Set-Job-Attributes and Set-Printer-Attributes operations are used to modify IPP Job objects and Printer objects, respectively. The third administrator Get-Printer-Supported-Values operation returns values that the IPP Printer will accept for setting its 'xxx-supported' attributes.},
