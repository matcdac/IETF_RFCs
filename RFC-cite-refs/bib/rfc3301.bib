	abstract =	{L2TP {[}RFC2661{]} specifies a protocol for tunnelling PPP packets over packet based networks and over IP networks in particular. L2TP {[}RFC2661{]} supports remote access by ISDN and PSTN networks. This document augments the procedures described in {[}RFC2661{]} to further support ATM SVC or PVC based access networks. The extensions defined within this document allow for asymmetric bi-directional call establishment and service selection in the ATM access network.},
