	abstract =	{This document describes two technology-independent extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS). The first extension defines the new switching type Data Channel Switching Capable. Data Channel Switching Capable interfaces are able to support switching of the whole digital channel presented on single channel interfaces. The second extension defines a new type of generalized label and updates related objects. The new label is called the Generalized Channel\_Set Label and allows more than one data plane label to be controlled as part of a Label Switched Path (LSP). {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
