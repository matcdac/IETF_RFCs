	abstract =	{The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) provides a standard method for tunneling PPP packets. The current specification provides no provisions for supporting Differentiated Services (diffserv) over the L2TP control connection or subsequent data sessions. As a result, no standard mechanism currently exists within L2TP to provide L2TP protocol negotiations for service discrimination.},
