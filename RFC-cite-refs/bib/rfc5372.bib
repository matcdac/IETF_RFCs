	abstract =	{This memo describes extended uses for the payload header in "RTP Payload Format for JPEG 2000 Video Streams" as specified in RFC 5371, for better support of JPEG 2000 features such as scalability and main header recovery. This memo must be accompanied with a complete implementation of "RTP Payload Format for JPEG 2000 Video Streams". That document is a complete description of the payload header and signaling, this document only describes additional processing for the payload header. There is an additional media type and Session Description Protocol (SDP) marker signaling for implementations of this document. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
