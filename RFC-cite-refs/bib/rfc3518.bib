	abstract =	{The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. PPP defines an extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP) and proposes a family of Network Control Protocols (NCP) for establishing and configuring different network-layer protocols. This document defines the NCP for establishing and configuring Remote Bridging for PPP links. This document obsoletes RFC 2878, which was based on the IEEE 802.1D- 1993 MAC Bridge. This document extends that specification by improving support for bridge control packets. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
