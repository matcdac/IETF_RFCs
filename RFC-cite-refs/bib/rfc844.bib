	abstract =	{This survey determines how many hosts are able to respond to TELENET connections from a user at a class C site. This requires, in addition to IP and TCP, participation in gateway routing via ICMP and handling of Class C addresses. The list of hosts was taken from RFC 843, extracting only those hosts which are listed there as accepting TELNET connection. The tests were run on 18-Feb-83.},
