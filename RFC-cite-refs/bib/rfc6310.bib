It standardizes the behavior of Provider Edges (PEs) with respect to PW and AC defects. It addresses ATM, Frame Relay, Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), and Synchronous Optical Network / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) PW services, carried over MPLS, MPLS/IP, and Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol version 3/IP (L2TPv3/IP) Packet Switched Networks (PSNs). {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
