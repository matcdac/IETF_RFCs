	abstract =	{RFCs 4328 and 7139 provide signaling extensions in Resource ReserVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) to control the full set of Optical Transport Network (OTN) features. However, these specifications do not cover the additional Optical channel Data Unit (ODU) containers defined in G.Sup43 (ODU1e, ODU3e1, and ODU3e2). This document defines new Signal Types for these additional containers.},
