	abstract =	{This document describes how the zone identifier of an IPv6 scoped address, defined as \textless{}zone\_id\textgreater{} in the IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture (RFC 4007), can be represented in a literal IPv6 address and in a Uniform Resource Identifier that includes such a literal address. It updates the URI Generic Syntax specification (RFC 3986) accordingly.},
