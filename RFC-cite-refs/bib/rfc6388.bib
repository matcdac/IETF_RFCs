	abstract =	{This document describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) for the setup of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) and multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in MPLS networks. These extensions are also referred to as multipoint LDP. Multipoint LDP constructs the P2MP or MP2MP LSPs without interacting with or relying upon any other multicast tree construction protocol. Protocol elements and procedures for this solution are described for building such LSPs in a receiver-initiated manner. There can be various applications for multipoint LSPs, for example IP multicast or support for multicast in BGP/MPLS Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks (L3VPNs). Specification of how such applications can use an LDP signaled multipoint LSP is outside the scope of this document. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
