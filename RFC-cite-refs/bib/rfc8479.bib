	abstract =	{This memo describes a method of storing parameters needed for private-key validation in the Private-Key Information Syntax Specification as defined in PKCS\#8 format (RFC 5208). It is equally applicable to the alternative implementation of the Private-Key Information Syntax Specification as defined in RFC 5958. The approach described in this document encodes the parameters under a private enterprise extension and does not form part of a formal standard.},
