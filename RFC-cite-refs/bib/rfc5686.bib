	abstract =	{This document describes the RTP payload format of a mU-law EMbedded Coder for Low-delay IP communication (UEMCLIP), an enhanced speech codec of ITU-T G.711. The bitstream has a scalable structure with an embedded u-law bitstream, also known as PCMU, thus providing a handy transcoding operation between narrowband and wideband speech. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
