	abstract =	{This specification is complementary to the GMPLS Ethernet Label Switching Architecture and Framework and describes the technology-specific aspects of GMPLS control for Provider Backbone Bridge Traffic Engineering (PBB-TE). The necessary GMPLS extensions and mechanisms are described to establish Ethernet PBB-TE point-to-point (P2P) and point-to-multipoint (P2MP) connections. This document supports, but does not modify, the standard IEEE data plane. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
