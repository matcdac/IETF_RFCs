This mirrors the use of a MAC combined with an encryption algorithm that's already employed in IPsec, Secure Socket Layer / Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) and Secure SHell (SSH), which is widely supported in existing crypto libraries and hardware and has been extensively analysed by the crypto community. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
