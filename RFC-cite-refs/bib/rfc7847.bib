	abstract =	{A logical interface is a software semantic internal to the host operating system. This semantic is available in all popular operating systems and is used in various protocol implementations. Logical-interface support is required on the mobile node attached to a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain for leveraging various network-based mobility management features such as inter-technology handoffs, multihoming, and flow mobility support. This document explains the operational details of the logical-interface construct and the specifics on how link-layer implementations hide the physical interfaces from the IP stack and from the network nodes on the attached access networks. Furthermore, this document identifies the applicability of this approach to various link-layer technologies and analyzes the issues around it when used in conjunction with various mobility management features.},
