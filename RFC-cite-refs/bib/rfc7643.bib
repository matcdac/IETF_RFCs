	abstract =	{The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specifications are designed to make identity management in cloud-based applications and services easier. The specification suite builds upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models. Its intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing a common user schema and extension model as well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema using HTTP. This document provides a platform-neutral schema and extension model for representing users and groups and other resource types in JSON format. This schema is intended for exchange and use with cloud service providers.},
