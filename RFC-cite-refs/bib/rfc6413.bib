	abstract =	{This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Link-State Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) Route Convergence. The methodology is to be used for benchmarking IGP convergence time through externally observable (black-box) data-plane measurements. The methodology can be applied to any link-state IGP, such as IS-IS and OSPF. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.},
