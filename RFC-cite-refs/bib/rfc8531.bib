	abstract =	{This document presents a base YANG data model for connection-oriented Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols. It provides a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for such protocols. The model presented here can be extended to include technology-specific details. This guarantees uniformity in the management of OAM protocols and provides support for nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different levels through a unified interface). The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture.},
