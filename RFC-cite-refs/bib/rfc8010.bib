This document defines the rules for encoding IPP operations, attributes, and values into the Internet MIME media type called "application/ipp". It also defines the rules for transporting a message body whose Content-Type is "application/ipp" over HTTP and/or HTTPS. The IPP data model and operation semantics are described in "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics" (RFC 8011).},
