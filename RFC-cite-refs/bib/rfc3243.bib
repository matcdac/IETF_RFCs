	abstract =	{This document contains requirements for the 0-byte IP/UDP/RTP (Internet Protocol/User Datagram Protocol/Real-Time Transport Protocol) header compression scheme to be developed by the Robust Header Compression (ROHC) Working Group. It also includes the basic assumptions for the typical link layers over which 0-byte compression may be implemented, and assumptions about its usage in general.},
