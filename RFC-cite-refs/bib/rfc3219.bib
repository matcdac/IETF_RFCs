	abstract =	{This document presents the Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP). TRIP is a policy driven inter-administrative domain protocol for advertising the reachability of telephony destinations between location servers, and for advertising attributes of the routes to those destinations. TRIP's operation is independent of any signaling protocol, hence TRIP can serve as the telephony routing protocol for any signaling protocol. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
