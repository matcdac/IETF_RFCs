	abstract =	{The original RObust Header Compression (ROHC) RFC (RFC 3095) defines a framework for header compression, along with compression protocols (profiles) for IP/UDP/RTP, IP/ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload), IP/UDP, and also a profile for uncompressed packet streams. However, no profile was defined for compression of IP only, which has been identified as a missing piece in RFC 3095. This document defines a ROHC compression profile for IP, similar to the IP/UDP profile defined by RFC 3095, but simplified to exclude UDP, and enhanced to compress IP header chains of arbitrary length. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
