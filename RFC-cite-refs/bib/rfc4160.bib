	abstract =	{To allow connectivity between the General Switched Telephone Network facsimile service (GSTN fax) and the e-mail-based Internet Fax service (i-fax) an "Internet Fax Gateway" is required. This document provides recommendations for the functionality of Internet Fax Gateways. In this context, an "offramp gateway" provides facsimile data transmission from i-fax to GSTN fax; vice versa, an "onramp gateway" provides data transmission form GSTN fax to i-fax. The recommendations in this document apply to the integrated service including Internet Fax terminals, computers with i-fax software on the Internet, and GSTN Fax terminals on the GSTN. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
