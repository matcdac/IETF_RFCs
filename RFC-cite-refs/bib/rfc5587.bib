	abstract =	{This document introduces new application programming interfaces (APIs) to the Generic Security Services API (GSS-API) for extended mechanism attribute inquiry. These interfaces are primarily intended to reduce instances of hardcoding of mechanism identifiers in GSS applications. These interfaces include mechanism attributes and attribute sets, a function for inquiring the attributes of a mechanism, a function for indicating mechanisms that possess given attributes, and a function for displaying mechanism attributes. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
