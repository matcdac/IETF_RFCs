	abstract =	{This document defines the format of an electronic signature that can remain valid over long periods. This includes evidence as to its validity even if the signer or verifying party later attempts to deny (i.e., repudiates) the validity of the signature. The format can be considered as an extension to RFC 3852 and RFC 2634, where, when appropriate, additional signed and unsigned attributes have been defined. The contents of this Informational RFC amount to a transposition of the ETSI Technical Specification (TS) 101 733 V.1.7.4 (CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures -- CAdES) and is technically equivalent to it. The technical contents of this specification are maintained by ETSI. The ETSI TS and further updates are available free of charge at: http://www.etsi.org/WebSite/Standards/StandardsDownload.aspx This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
