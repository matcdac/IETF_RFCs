	abstract =	{The Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) specification and the Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extensions to RSVP-TE allow abstract nodes and resources to be explicitly included in a path setup. Further, Exclude Route extensions to RSVP-TE allow abstract nodes and resources to be explicitly excluded in a path setup. This document specifies new subobjects to include or exclude Autonomous Systems (ASes), which are identified by a 4-byte AS number, and Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas during path setup.},
