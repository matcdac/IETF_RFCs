	abstract =	{This document presents a performance comparison between the per-domain path computation method and the Path Computation Element (PCE) Architecture-based Backward Recursive Path Computation (BRPC) procedure. Metrics to capture the significant performance aspects are identified, and detailed simulations are carried out on realistic scenarios. A performance analysis for each of the path computation methods is then undertaken. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
