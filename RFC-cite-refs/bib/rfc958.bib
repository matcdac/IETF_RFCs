	abstract =	{This document describes the Network Time Protocol (NTP), a protocol for synchronizing a set of network clocks using a set of distributed clients and servers. NTP is built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which provides a connectionless transport mechanism. It is evolved from the Time Protocol and the ICMP Timestamp message and is a suitable replacement for both. This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.},
