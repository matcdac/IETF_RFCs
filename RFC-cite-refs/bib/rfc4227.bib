	abstract =	{This memo specifies a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) binding to the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) core. A SOAP binding describes how SOAP messages are transmitted in the network. The SOAP is an XML-based (eXtensible Markup Language) messaging protocol used to implement a wide variety of distributed messaging models. It defines a message format and describes a variety of message patterns, including, but not limited to, Remote Procedure Calling (RPC), asynchronous event notification, unacknowledged messages, and forwarding via SOAP intermediaries. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
