	abstract =	{This memo defines an echo function for the connection-less network layer protocol. Two mechanisms are introduced that may be used to implement the echo function. The first mechanism is recommended as an interim solution for the Internet community. The second mechanism will be progressed to the ANSI X3S3.3 working group for consideration as a work item. When an ISO standard is adopted that provides functionality similar to that described by this memo, then this memo will become obsolete and superceded by the ISO standard. This memo is not intended to compete with an ISO standard. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
