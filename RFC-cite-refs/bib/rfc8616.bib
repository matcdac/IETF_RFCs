	abstract =	{Sender Policy Framework (SPF) (RFC 7208), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) (RFC 6376), and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) (RFC 7489) enable a domain owner to publish email authentication and policy information in the DNS. In internationalized email, domain names can occur both as U-labels and A-labels. This specification updates the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC specifications to clarify which form of internationalized domain names to use in those specifications.},
