	abstract =	{The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) identifies users by use of Jabber IDs (JIDs). The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) enables provision of a white pages service with a schema relating to users and support for Internet protocols. This specification defines a schema to enable XMPP JIDs to be associated with objects in an LDAP directory so that this information can be used with white pages applications.},
