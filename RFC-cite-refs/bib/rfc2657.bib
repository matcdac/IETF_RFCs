	abstract =	{LDAPv2 clients as implemented according to RFC 1777 have no notion on referral. The integration between such a client and an Index Mesh, as defined by the Common Indexing Protocol, heavily depends on referrals and therefore needs to be handled in a special way. This document defines one possible way of doing this. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.},
