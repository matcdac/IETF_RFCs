	abstract =	{This document describes a new Port Control Protocol (PCP) option called the THIRD\_PARTY\_ID option. It is designed to be used together with the THIRD\_PARTY option specified in RFC 6887. The THIRD\_PARTY\_ID option serves to identify a third party in situations where a third party's IP address contained in the THIRD\_PARTY option does not provide sufficient information to create requested mappings in a PCP-controlled device.},
