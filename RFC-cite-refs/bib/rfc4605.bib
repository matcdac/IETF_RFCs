	abstract =	{In certain topologies, it is not necessary to run a multicast routing protocol. It is sufficient for a device to learn and proxy group membership information and simply forward multicast packets based upon that information. This document describes a mechanism for forwarding based solely upon Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) or Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) membership information. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
