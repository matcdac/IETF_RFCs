	abstract =	{This document defines and describes the IntermediateResponse message, a general mechanism for defining single-request/multiple-response operations in Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). The IntermediateResponse message is defined in such a way that the protocol behavior of existing LDAP operations is maintained. This message is intended to be used in conjunction with the LDAP ExtendedRequest and ExtendedResponse to define new single-request/multiple-response operations or in conjunction with a control when extending existing LDAP operations in a way that requires them to return intermediate response information. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
