	abstract =	{This document describes how a Mobile IPv6 Fast Handover can be implemented on link layers conforming to the IEEE 802.16e suite of specifications. The proposed scheme tries to achieve seamless handover by exploiting the link-layer handover indicators and thereby synchronizing the IEEE 802.16e handover procedures with the Mobile IPv6 fast handover procedures efficiently. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
