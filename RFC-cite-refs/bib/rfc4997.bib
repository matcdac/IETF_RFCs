	abstract =	{This document defines Robust Header Compression - Formal Notation (ROHC-FN), a formal notation to specify field encodings for compressed formats when defining new profiles within the ROHC framework. ROHC-FN offers a library of encoding methods that are often used in ROHC profiles and can thereby help to simplify future profile development work. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
