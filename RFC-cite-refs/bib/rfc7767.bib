	abstract =	{This document specifies a mechanism for a host to indicate via the Port Control Protocol (PCP) which connections should be protected against network failures. These connections will then be subject to high-availability mechanisms enabled on the network side. This approach assumes that applications and/or users have more visibility about sensitive connections than any heuristic that can be enabled on the network side to guess which connections should be check-pointed.},
