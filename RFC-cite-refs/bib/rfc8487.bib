	abstract =	{This document describes the IP multicast traceroute facility, named Mtrace version 2 (Mtrace2). Unlike unicast traceroute, Mtrace2 requires special implementations on the part of routers. This specification describes the required functionality in multicast routers, as well as how an Mtrace2 client invokes a Query and receives a Reply.},
