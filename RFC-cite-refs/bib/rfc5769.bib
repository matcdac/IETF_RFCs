	abstract =	{The Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol defines several STUN attributes. The content of some of these -- FINGERPRINT, MESSAGE-INTEGRITY, and XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS -- involve binary-logical operations (hashing, xor). This document provides test vectors for those attributes.
