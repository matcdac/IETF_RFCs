	abstract =	{RFC 2658 specifies the streaming format for 3GPP2 13KK vocoder (High Rate Speech Service Option 17 for Wideband Spread Spectrum Communications Systems, also known as QCELP 13K vocoder) data, but does not specify a storage format. Many implementations have been using the "QCP" file format (named for its file extension) for exchanging QCELP 13K data as well as Enhanced Variable Rate Coder (EVRC) and Selectable Mode Vocoders (SMV) data. (For example, Eudora(r), QuickTime(r), and cmda2000(r) handsets). This document specifies the QCP file format and updates the audio/qcelp media registration to specify this format for storage, and registers the audio/evrc-qcp and audio/smv-qcp media types for EVRC and SMV (respectively) data stored in this format.},
