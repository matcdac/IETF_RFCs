	abstract =	{This document specifies a symmetric key format for the transport and provisioning of symmetric keys to different types of crypto modules. For example, One-Time Password (OTP) shared secrets or symmetric cryptographic keys to strong authentication devices. A standard key transport format enables enterprises to deploy best-of-breed solutions combining components from different vendors into the same infrastructure. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
