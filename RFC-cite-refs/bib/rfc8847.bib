	abstract =	{The Controlling Multiple Streams for Telepresence (CLUE) protocol is an application protocol conceived for the description and negotiation of a telepresence session. The design of the CLUE protocol takes into account the requirements and the framework defined within the IETF CLUE Working Group. A companion document, RFC 8848, delves into CLUE signaling details as well as the SIP / Session Description Protocol (SDP) session establishment phase. CLUE messages flow over the CLUE data channel, based on reliable and ordered SCTP-over-DTLS transport. ("SCTP" stands for "Stream Control Transmission Protocol".) Message details, together with the behavior of CLUE Participants acting as Media Providers and/or Media Consumers, are herein discussed.},
