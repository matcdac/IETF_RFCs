	abstract =	{A pseudowire (PW) can be used to carry Point to Point Protocol (PPP) or High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) Protocol Data Units over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network without terminating the PPP/HDLC protocol. This enables service providers to offer "emulated" HDLC, or PPP link services over existing MPLS networks. This document specifies the encapsulation of PPP/HDLC Packet Data Units (PDUs) within a pseudowire. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
