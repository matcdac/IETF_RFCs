	abstract =	{A micro-loop is a packet-forwarding loop that may occur transiently among two or more routers in a hop-by-hop packet-forwarding paradigm. This document analyzes the impact of using different link state IGP implementations in a single network with respect to micro-loops. The analysis is focused on the Shortest Path First (SPF) delay algorithm but also mentions the impact of SPF trigger strategies.},
