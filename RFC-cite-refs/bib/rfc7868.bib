	abstract =	{This document describes the protocol design and architecture for Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP). EIGRP is a routing protocol based on Distance Vector technology. The specific algorithm used is called "DUAL", a Diffusing Update Algorithm as referenced in "Loop-Free Routing Using Diffusing Computations" (Garcia-Luna-Aceves 1993). The algorithm and procedures were researched, developed, and simulated by SRI International.},
