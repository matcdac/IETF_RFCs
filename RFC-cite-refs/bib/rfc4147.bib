	abstract =	{This document proposes a revised format for the IANA IPv6 address registries. Rather than providing a formal definition of the format, it is described by giving examples of the (current as of preparation of this document) contents of the registries in the proposed format. The proposed format would bring the IANA IPv6 address registries into alignment with the current IPv6 Address Architecture specification, as well as update it to a more useful and generally accepted format. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
