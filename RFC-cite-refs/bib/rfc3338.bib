	abstract =	{This document specifies a mechanism of dual stack hosts using a technique called 'Bump-in-the-API'(BIA) which allows for the hosts to communicate with other IPv6 hosts using existing IPv4 applications. The goal of this mechanism is the same as that of the Bump-in-the-stack mechanism {[}BIS{]}, but this mechanism provides the translation method between the IPv4 APIs and IPv6 APIs. Thus, the goal is simply achieved without IP header translation.},
