	abstract =	{This document defines a framework for creating WebSocket extensions that add compression functionality to the WebSocket Protocol. An extension based on this framework compresses the payload data portion of WebSocket data messages on a per-message basis using parameters negotiated during the opening handshake. This framework provides a general method for applying a compression algorithm to the contents of WebSocket messages. Each compression algorithm has to be defined in a document defining the extension by specifying the parameter negotiation and the payload transformation algorithm in detail. This document also specifies one specific compression extension using the DEFLATE algorithm.},
