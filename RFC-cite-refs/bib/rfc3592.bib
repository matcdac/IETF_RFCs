	abstract =	{This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular, it defines objects for managing Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) interfaces. This document is a companion to the documents that define Managed Objects for the DS1/E1/DS2/E2 and DS3/E3 Interface Types. This memo replaces RFC 2558. Changes relative to RFC 2558 are summarized in the MIB module's REVISION clause. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
