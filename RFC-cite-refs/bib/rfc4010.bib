	abstract =	{This document specifies the conventions for using the SEED encryption algorithm for encryption with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). SEED is added to the set of optional symmetric encryption algorithms in CMS by providing two classes of unique object identifiers (OIDs). One OID class defines the content encryption algorithms and the other defines the key encryption algorithms. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
