	abstract =	{This document defines a Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2) Management Information Base (MIB) module for configuring the security policy database of a device implementing the IPsec protocol. The policy-based packet filtering and the corresponding execution of actions described in this document are of a more general nature than for IPsec configuration alone, such as for configuration of a firewall. This MIB module is designed to be extensible with other enterprise or standards-based defined packet filters and actions. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
