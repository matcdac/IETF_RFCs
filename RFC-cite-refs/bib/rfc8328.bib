	abstract =	{The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) policy-based management framework defines base YANG data models to encode policy. These models point to device-, technology-, and service-specific YANG data models developed elsewhere. Policy rules within an operator's environment can be used to express high-level, possibly network-wide, policies to a network management function (within a controller, an orchestrator, or a network element). The network management function can then control the configuration and/or monitoring of network elements and services. This document describes the SUPA basic framework, its elements, and interfaces.},
