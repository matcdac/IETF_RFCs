	abstract =	{This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it defines objects for managing IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs). This document obsoletes RFC 3636. It amends that specification by moving MAU type OBJECT-IDENTITY definitions and relevant textual conventions into a separate Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) maintained MIB module. In addition, management information is added to enable support for Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) and 10GBASE-CX4 MAUs. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
