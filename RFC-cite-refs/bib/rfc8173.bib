	abstract =	{This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in internets based on TCP or IP. In particular, it defines objects for managing networks using the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), specified in IEEE Std. 1588-2008. This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant to the Structure of Management Information version 2 (SMIv2) and semantically identical to the peer SMIv1 definitions.},
