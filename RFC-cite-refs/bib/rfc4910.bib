	abstract =	{This document defines a set of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) encoding rules, called the Robust XML Encoding Rules or RXER, that produce an Extensible Markup Language (XML) representation for values of any given ASN.1 data type. Rules for producing a canonical RXER encoding are also defined. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.},
