	abstract =	{The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) allows a Centralized Conferencing (XCON) system client to create, retrieve, change, and delete objects that describe a centralized conference. CCMP is a means to control basic and advanced conference features such as conference state and capabilities, participants, relative roles, and details. CCMP is a stateless, XML-based, client server protocol that carries, in its request and response messages, conference information in the form of XML documents and fragments conforming to the centralized conferencing data model schema. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
