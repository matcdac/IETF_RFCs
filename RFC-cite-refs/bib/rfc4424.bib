	abstract =	{This document is an addendum to RFC 4348, which specifies the RTP payload format for the Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) speech codec. This document specifies some updates in RFC 4348 to enable support for the new operating mode of VMR-WB standard (i.e., VMR-WB mode 4). These updates do not affect the existing modes of VMR-WB already specified in RFC 4348. The payload formats and their associated parameters, as well as all provisions, restrictions, use cases, features, etc., that are specified in RFC 4348 are applicable to the new operating mode with no exception. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
