	abstract =	{This document defines additional Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol Version 3 (L2TPv3) bit values to be used within the "Circuit Status" Attribute Value Pair (AVP) to communicate finer-grained error states for Attachment Circuits (ACs) and pseudowires (PWs). It also generalizes the Active bit and deprecates the use of the New bit in the Circuit Status AVP, updating RFC 3931, RFC 4349, RFC 4454, RFC 4591, and RFC 4719. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
