	abstract =	{This memo discusses subnets and proposes procedures for the use of subnets, including approaches to solving the problems that arise, particularly that of routing. A subnet of an Internet network is a logically visible sub-section of a single Internet network. For administrative or technical reasons, many organizations have chosen to divide one Internet network into several subnets, instead of acquiring a set of Internet network numbers. This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.},
