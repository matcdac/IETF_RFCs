	abstract =	{This memo defines Management Information Bases (MIBs) for performing ping, traceroute, and lookup operations at a host. When managing a network, it is useful to be able to initiate and retrieve the results of ping or traceroute operations when they are performed at a remote host. A lookup capability is defined in order to enable resolution of either an IP address to an DNS name or a DNS name to an IP address at a remote host. Currently, there are several enterprise-specific MIBs for performing remote ping or traceroute operations. The purpose of this memo is to define a standards-based solution to enable interoperability. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
