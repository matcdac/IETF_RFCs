	abstract =	{The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) {[}RFC2661{]} provides a standard method for transporting the link layer of PPP {[}RFC1661{]} between a dial-up server and a Network Access Server, using a network connection in lieu of a physical point to point connection. This document describes the use of an ATM network for the underlying network connection. ATM User-Network Interface (UNI) Signalling Specification Version 4.0 {[}SIG40{]} or Version 3.1 {[}SIG31{]} with ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) {[}ITU93{]} are supported as interfaces to the ATM network.},
