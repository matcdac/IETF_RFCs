	abstract =	{This document describes a protocol providing Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) as a new transport for Remote Procedure Call (RPC). The RDMA transport binding conveys the benefits of efficient, bulk-data transport over high-speed networks, while providing for minimal change to RPC applications and with no required revision of the application RPC protocol, or the RPC protocol itself. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
