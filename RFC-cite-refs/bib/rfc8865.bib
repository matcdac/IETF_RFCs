	abstract =	{This document specifies how a Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) data channel can be used as a transport mechanism for real-time text using the ITU-T Protocol for multimedia application text conversation (Recommendation ITU-T T.140) and how the Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer mechanism can be used to negotiate such a data channel, referred to as a T.140 data channel. This document updates RFC 8373 to specify its use with WebRTC data channels.},
