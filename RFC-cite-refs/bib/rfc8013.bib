	abstract =	{This document describes how to extend the Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) Logical Functional Block (LFB) topology across Forwarding Elements (FEs) by defining the inter-FE LFB class. The inter-FE LFB class provides the ability to pass data and metadata across FEs without needing any changes to the ForCES specification. The document focuses on Ethernet transport.},
