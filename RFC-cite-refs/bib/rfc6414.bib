	abstract =	{This document provides common terminology and metrics for benchmarking the performance of sub-IP layer protection mechanisms. The performance benchmarks are measured at the IP layer; protection may be provided at the sub-IP layer. The benchmarks and terminology can be applied in methodology documents for different sub-IP layer protection mechanisms such as Automatic Protection Switching (APS), Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), Stateful High Availability (HA), and Multiprotocol Label Switching Fast Reroute (MPLS-FRR). This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.},
