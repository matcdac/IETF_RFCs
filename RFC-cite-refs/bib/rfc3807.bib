	abstract =	{This document defines a mechanism for the backhauling of V5.2 messages over IP using the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). This protocol may be used between a Signaling Gateway (SG) and a Media Gateway controller (MGC). It is assumed that the SG receives V5.2 signaling over a standard V5.2 interface. This document builds on the ISDN User Adaptation Layer Protocol (RFC 3057). It defines all necessary extensions to the IUA Protocol needed for the V5UA protocol implementation. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
