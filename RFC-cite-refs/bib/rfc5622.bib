	abstract =	{This document specifies a profile for Congestion Control Identifier 4, the small-packet variant of TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC), in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP). CCID 4 is for experimental use, and uses TFRC-SP (RFC 4828), a variant of TFRC designed for applications that send small packets. CCID 4 is considered experimental because TFRC-SP is itself experimental, and is not proposed for widespread deployment in the global Internet at this time. The goal for TFRC-SP is to achieve roughly the same bandwidth in bits per second (bps) as a TCP flow using packets of up to 1500 bytes but experiencing the same level of congestion. CCID 4 is for use for senders that send small packets and would like a TCP- friendly sending rate, possibly with Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), while minimizing abrupt rate changes. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.},
