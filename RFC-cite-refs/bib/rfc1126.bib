	abstract =	{This document describes the functional requirements for a routing protocol to be used between autonomous systems. This document is intended as a necessary precursor to the design of a new inter- autonomous system routing protocol and specifies requirements for the Internet applicable for use with the current DoD IP, the ISO IP, and future Internet Protocols. It is intended that these requirements will form the basis for the future development of a new inter-autonomous systems routing architecture and protocol. This memo does not specify a standard.},
