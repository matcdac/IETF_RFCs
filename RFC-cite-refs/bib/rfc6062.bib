	abstract =	{This specification defines an extension of Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN), a relay protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal. This extension allows a TURN client to request TCP allocations, and defines new requests and indications for the TURN server to open and accept TCP connections with the client\textbackslash{}'s peers. TURN and this extension both purposefully restrict the ways in which the relayed address can be used. In particular, it prevents users from running general-purpose servers from ports obtained from the TURN server. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
