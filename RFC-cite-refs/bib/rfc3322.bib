	abstract =	{In wireless environments and especially in cellular systems, e.g. GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) and UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), there is a need to maximize the transport efficiency for data over the radio interface. With the introduction of SIP/SDP (Session Initiation Protocol/Session Description Protocol) to cellular devices, compression of the signaling messages should be considered in order to improve both service availability and quality, mainly by reducing the user idle time, e.g. at call setup. The purpose of this document is to outline requirements and motivations for development of a scheme for compression and decompression of messages from signaling protocols.},
