	abstract =	{OSPFv3 is a candidate for deployments in environments where autoconfiguration is a requirement. One such environment is the IPv6 home network where users expect to simply plug in a router and have it automatically use OSPFv3 for intra-domain routing. This document describes the necessary mechanisms for OSPFv3 to be self-configuring. This document updates RFC 5340 by relaxing the HelloInterval/ RouterDeadInterval checking during OSPFv3 adjacency formation and adding hysteresis to the update of self-originated Link State Advertisements (LSAs).},
