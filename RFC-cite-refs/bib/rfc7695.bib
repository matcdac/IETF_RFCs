	abstract =	{This document specifies a distributed algorithm for dividing a set of prefixes in a manner that allows for automatic assignment of sub-prefixes that are unique and non-overlapping. Used in conjunction with a protocol that provides flooding of information among a set of participating nodes, prefix configuration within a network may be automated.},
