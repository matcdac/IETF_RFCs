	abstract =	{RFC 6513 ("Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs") describes a method to support bidirectional customer multicast flows using a partial mesh of Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) tunnels. This document specifies how a partial mesh of MP2MP tunnels can be simulated using Ingress Replication. This solution enables a service provider to use Ingress Replication to offer transparent bidirectional multicast service to its VPN customers.},
