	abstract =	{This document describes a framework and several scenarios for a pseudowire (PW) dual-homing local protection mechanism that avoids unnecessary switchovers and does not depend on whether a control plane is used. A Dual-Node Interconnection (DNI) PW is used to carry traffic between the dual-homing Provider Edge (PE) nodes when a failure occurs in one of the Attachment Circuits (AC) or PWs. This PW dual-homing local protection mechanism is complementary to existing PW protection mechanisms.},
