	abstract =	{This document describes the properties and use of a revised Microsoft Word template (.dot) for writing Internet Drafts and RFCs. It replaces the initial template described in RFC 3285 to more fully support Word's outline modes and to be easier to use. This template can be direct-printed and direct-viewed, where either is line-for-line identical with RFC Editor-compliant ASCII output. This version obsoletes RFC 3285. The most recent version of this template and post-processing scripts are available at http://www.isi.edu/touch/tools. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.},
