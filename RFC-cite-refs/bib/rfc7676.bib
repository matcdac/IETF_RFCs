	abstract =	{Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) can be used to carry any network- layer payload protocol over any network-layer delivery protocol. Currently, GRE procedures are specified for IPv4, used as either the payload or delivery protocol. However, GRE procedures are not specified for IPv6. This document specifies GRE procedures for IPv6, used as either the payload or delivery protocol.},
