	abstract =	{As the deployment of second and third generation cellular networks progresses, a large number of cellular hosts are being connected to the Internet. Standardization organizations are making IPv6 mandatory in their specifications. However, the concept of IPv6 covers many aspects and numerous specifications. In addition, the characteristics of cellular links in terms of bandwidth, cost and delay put special requirements on how IPv6 is used. This document considers IPv6 for cellular hosts that attach to the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), or Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks. The document lists basic components of IPv6 functionality and discusses some issues relating to the use of these components when operating in these networks.},
