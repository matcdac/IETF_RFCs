	abstract =	{By introducing new Information Elements (IEs), this document extends the existing BGP-related IEs to enable IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) to export BGP community information, including the BGP Standard Communities defined in RFC 1997, BGP Extended Communities defined in RFC 4360, and BGP Large Communities defined in RFC 8092. According to the network operator's BGP community planning, network traffic information can then be accumulated and analyzed at the BGP community granularity, which represents the traffic of different kinds of customers, services, or geographical regions. Network traffic information at the BGP community granularity is useful for network traffic analysis and engineering.},
