	abstract =	{This document defines a simple enhancement to support RTP sessions with forward-shifted redundant encodings, i.e., redundant data sent before the corresponding primary data. Forward-shifted redundancy can be used to conceal losses of a large number of consecutive media frames (e.g., consecutive loss of seconds or even tens of seconds of media). {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
