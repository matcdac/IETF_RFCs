	abstract =	{Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) is a SCSI transport protocol that maps the SCSI family of protocols onto TCP/IP. The iSCSI protocol as specified in RFC 7143 (and as previously specified by the combination of RFC 3720 and RFC 5048) is based on the SAM-2 (SCSI Architecture Model - 2) version of the SCSI family of protocols. This document defines enhancements to the iSCSI protocol to support certain additional features of the SCSI protocol that were defined in SAM-3, SAM-4, and SAM-5.},
