	abstract =	{This document suggests a method of using DNS to determine the network that contains a specified IP address, the netmask of that network, and the address(es) of first-hop routers(s) on that network. This method supports variable-length subnet masks, delegation of subnets on non-octet boundaries, and multiple routers per subnet. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
