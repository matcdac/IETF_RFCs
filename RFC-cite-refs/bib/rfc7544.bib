	abstract =	{Although the SIP History-Info header field described in RFC 7044 is the solution adopted in IETF, the non-standard Diversion header field described, as Historic, in RFC 5806 is nevertheless already implemented and used for conveying call-diversion-related information in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling. RFC 7044 obsoletes the original RFC 4244 and redefines the History-Info header field for capturing the history information in requests. Since the Diversion header field is used in existing network implementations for the transport of call diversion information, its interworking with the SIP History-Info standardized solution is needed. This document describes a recommended interworking guideline between the Diversion header field and the History-Info header field to handle call diversion information. This work is intended to enable the migration from non-standard implementations toward IETF specification-based implementations. This document obsoletes RFC 6044, which describes the interworking between the Diversion header field defined in RFC 5806 and the obsoleted History-Info header field defined on RFC 4244.},
