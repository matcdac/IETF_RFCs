	abstract =	{Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is designed to verify multipoint connectivity. This document specifies the support of P2MP BFD in Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL). Similar to TRILL point-to-point BFD, BFD Control packets in TRILL P2MP BFD are transmitted using RBridge Channel messages. This document updates RFCs 7175 and 7177.},
