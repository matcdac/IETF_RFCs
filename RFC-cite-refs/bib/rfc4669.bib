	abstract =	{This memo defines a set of extensions that instrument RADIUS authentication server functions. These extensions represent a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. Using these extensions, IP-based management stations can manage RADIUS authentication servers. This memo obsoletes RFC 2619 by deprecating the MIB table containing IPv4-only address formats and defining a new table to add support for version-neutral IP address formats. The remaining MIB objects from RFC 2619 are carried forward into this document. This memo also adds UNITS and REFERENCE clauses to selected objects. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
