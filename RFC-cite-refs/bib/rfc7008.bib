	abstract =	{This document describes the KCipher-2 encryption algorithm. KCipher-2 is a stream cipher with a 128-bit key and a 128-bit initialization vector. Since the algorithm for KCipher-2 was published in 2007, security and efficiency have been rigorously evaluated through academic and industrial studies. As of the publication of this document, no security vulnerabilities have been found. KCipher-2 offers fast encryption and decryption by means of simple operations that enable efficient implementation. KCipher-2 has been used for industrial applications, especially for mobile health monitoring and diagnostic services in Japan.},
