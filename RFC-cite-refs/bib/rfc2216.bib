	abstract =	{This document defines a framework for specifying services provided by network elements, and available to applications, in an internetwork which offers multiple qualities of service. The document first provides some necessary context -- including relevant definitions and suggested data formats -- and then specifies a "template" which service specification documents should follow. This memo provides information for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.},
