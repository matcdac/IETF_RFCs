	abstract =	{The concept of channel binding allows applications to establish that the two end-points of a secure channel at one network layer are the same as at a higher layer by binding authentication at the higher layer to the channel at the lower layer. This allows applications to delegate session protection to lower layers, which has various performance benefits. This document discusses and formalizes the concept of channel binding to secure channels. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
