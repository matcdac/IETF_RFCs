	abstract =	{This memo describes a proposed authentication protocol for verifying the identity of a user of a TCP connection. Given a TCP port number pair, it returns a character string which identifies the owner of that connection on the server's system. Suggested uses include automatic identification and verification of a user during an FTP session, additional verification of a TAC dial up user, and access verification for a generalized network file server.},
