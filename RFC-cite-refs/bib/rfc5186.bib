	abstract =	{The definitions of the Internet Group Management Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) and Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) require new behavior within the multicast routing protocols. The additional source information contained in IGMPv3 and MLDv2 messages necessitates that multicast routing protocols manage and utilize the information. This document describes how multicast routing protocols will interact with these source-filtering group management protocols. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
