	abstract =	{This document defines two new configuration attributes for the Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2). These attributes can be used for carrying the IPv4 address and IPv6 address of the Proxy-Call Session Control Function (P-CSCF). When an IPsec gateway delivers these attributes to an IPsec client, the IPsec client can obtain the IPv4 and/or IPv6 address of the P-CSCF server located in the 3GPP network.},
