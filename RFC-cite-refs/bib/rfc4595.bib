	abstract =	{This document describes the use of IKEv2 to negotiate security protocols and transforms for Fibre Channel as part of the Fibre Channel Security Association Management Protocol. This usage requires that IKEv2 be extended with Fibre-Channel-specific security protocols, transforms, and name types. This document specifies these IKEv2 extensions and allocates identifiers for them. Using new IKEv2 identifiers for Fibre Channel security protocols avoids any possible confusion between IKEv2 negotiation for IP networks and IKEv2 negotiation for Fibre Channel. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
