	abstract =	{An Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) Pseudowire (PW) is used to carry ATM cells over an MPLS network. This enables service providers to offer "emulated" ATM services over existing MPLS networks. This document specifies methods for the encapsulation of ATM cells within a pseudowire. It also specifies the procedures for using a PW to provide an ATM service. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
