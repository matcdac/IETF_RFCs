	abstract =	{This document provides suggestions for measuring OSPF single router control plane convergence. Its initial emphasis is on the control plane of a single OSPF router. We do not address forwarding plane performance. NOTE: In this document, the word "convergence" relates to single router control plane convergence only. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
