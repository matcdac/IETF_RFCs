	abstract =	{This document defines a master key used between a client of the Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) and an enforcement point, for bootstrapping lower-layer ciphering. The master key is derived from the Master Session Key of the Extensible Authentication Protocol as a result of successful PANA authentication. The master key guarantees cryptographic independence among enforcement points bootstrapped from PANA authentication across different address families. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
