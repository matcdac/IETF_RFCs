	abstract =	{PPP over ATM Adaptation Layer 2 defines the encapsulation that allows a PPP session to be transported over an ATM virtual circuit using the AAL2 adaptation layer. This document defines a set of class extensions to PPP over AAL2 that implement equivalent functionality to Multi Class Multi Link PPP over a single ATM virtual circuit. Instead of using Multi Link PPP as the basis for fragmentation functionality, this document uses the functionality of the Segmentation and Reassembly Service Specific Convergence Sublayer that is already required as the basic encapsulation format of PPP over AAL2.},
