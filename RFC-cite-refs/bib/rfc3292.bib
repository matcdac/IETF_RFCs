	abstract =	{This document describes the General Switch Management Protocol Version 3 (GSMPv3). The GSMPv3 is an asymmetric protocol that allows one or more external switch controllers to establish and maintain the state of a label switch such as, an ATM, frame relay or MPLS switch. The GSMPv3 allows control of both unicast and multicast switch connection state as well as control of switch system resources and QoS features. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
