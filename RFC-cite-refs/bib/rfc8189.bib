	abstract =	{The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol, specified in RFC 7285, defines several services that return various metrics describing the costs between network endpoints. This document defines a new service that allows an ALTO Client to retrieve several cost metrics in a single request for an ALTO filtered cost map and endpoint cost map. In addition, it extends the constraints to further filter those maps by allowing an ALTO Client to specify a logical combination of tests on several cost metrics.},
