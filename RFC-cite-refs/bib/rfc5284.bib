	abstract =	{The Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) defines an ERROR\_SPEC object for communicating errors. That object has a defined format that permits the definition of 256 error codes. As RSVP has been developed and extended, the convention has been to be conservative in defining new error codes. Further, no provision for user-defined errors exists in RSVP. This document defines a USER\_ERROR\_SPEC to be used in addition to the ERROR\_SPEC to carry additional user information related to errors. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
