	abstract =	{Overhead due to the movement of user data in the end-system network I/O processing path at high speeds is significant, and has limited the use of Internet protocols in interconnection networks, and the Internet itself -- especially where high bandwidth, low latency, and/or low overhead are required by the hosted application. This document examines this overhead, and addresses an architectural, IP-based "copy avoidance" solution for its elimination, by enabling Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA). This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
