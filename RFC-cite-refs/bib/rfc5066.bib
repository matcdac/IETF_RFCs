	abstract =	{This document defines Management Information Base (MIB) modules for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. This document describes extensions to the Ethernet-like Interfaces MIB and Medium Attachment Unit (MAU) MIB modules with a set of objects for managing Ethernet in the First Mile Copper (EFMCu) interfaces 10PASS-TS and 2BASE-TL, defined in IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004 (note: IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004 has been integrated into IEEE Std 802.3- 2005). In addition, a set of objects is defined, describing cross- connect capability of a managed device with multi-layer (stacked) interfaces, extending the stack management objects in the Interfaces Group MIB and the Inverted Stack Table MIB modules. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
