	abstract =	{This document updates RFC 5043 and RFC 5044 by extending Marker Protocol Data Unit (PDU) Aligned Framing (MPA) negotiation for Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) connection establishment. The first enhancement extends RFC 5044, enabling peer-to-peer connection establishment over MPA / Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The second enhancement extends both RFC 5043 and RFC 5044, by providing an option for standardized exchange of RDMA-layer connection configuration. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
