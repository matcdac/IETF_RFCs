	abstract =	{This memo specifies two elliptic curves over prime fields that offer a high level of practical security in cryptographic applications, including Transport Layer Security (TLS). These curves are intended to operate at the \textasciitilde{}128-bit and \textasciitilde{}224-bit security level, respectively, and are generated deterministically based on a list of required properties.},
