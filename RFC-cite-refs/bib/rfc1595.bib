	abstract =	{This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular, it defines objects for managing Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) objects. This document is a companion document with Definitions of Managed Objects for the DS1/E1 and DS3/E3 Interface Types, RFC1406 and RFC1407. This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1 definitions.},
