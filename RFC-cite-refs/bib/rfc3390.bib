	abstract =	{This document specifies an optional standard for TCP to increase the permitted initial window from one segment to roughly 4K bytes, replacing RFC 2414. This document discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the higher initial window. The document includes discussion of experiments and simulations showing that the higher initial window does not lead to congestion collapse. Finally, the document provides guidance on implementation issues.},
