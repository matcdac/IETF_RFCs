	abstract =	{This document defines SigComp, a solution for compressing messages generated by application protocols such as SIP {[}RFC-2543{]} and RTSP {[}RFC-2326{]}. The architecture and pre-requisites of SigComp are outlined, along with the format of the SigComp message. Decompression functionality for SigComp is provided by a 'Universal Decompressor Virtual Machine' optimized for the task of running decompression algorithms. The UDVM can be configured to understand the output of many well-known compressors such as DEFLATE {[}RFC-1951{]}.},
