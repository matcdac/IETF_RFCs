	abstract =	{This document describes an extension to Generalized MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) signaling to support communication of alarm information. GMPLS signaling already supports the control of alarm reporting, but not the communication of alarm information. This document presents both a functional description and GMPLS-RSVP specifics of such an extension. This document also proposes modification of the RSVP ERROR\_SPEC object. This document updates RFC 3473, "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions", through the addition of new, optional protocol elements. It does not change, and is fully backward compatible with, the procedures specified in RFC 3473. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
