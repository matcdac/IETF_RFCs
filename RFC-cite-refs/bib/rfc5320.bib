	abstract =	{For the purpose of this document, subnetworks are defined as virtual topologies that span connected network regions bounded by encapsulating border nodes. These virtual topologies may span multiple IP and/or sub-IP layer forwarding hops, and can introduce failure modes due to packet duplication and/or links with diverse Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs). This document specifies a Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) that accommodates such virtual topologies over diverse underlying link technologies. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.},
