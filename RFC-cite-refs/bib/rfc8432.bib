	abstract =	{The unification of control and management of microwave radio link interfaces is a precondition for seamless multi-layer networking and automated network provisioning and operation. This document describes the required characteristics and use cases for control and management of radio link interface parameters using a YANG data model. The purpose is to create a framework to identify the necessary information elements and define a YANG data model for control and management of the radio link interfaces in a microwave node. Some parts of the resulting model may be generic and could also be used by other technologies, e.g., Ethernet technology.},
