	abstract =	{This document defines a Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) package to support fax calls. The package allows for fax calls to be supported in two different ways. The first one utilizes ITU-T Recommendation T.38 for fax relay under the control of the Call Agent. The second one lets the gateway decide upon a method for fax transmission as well as handle the details of the fax call without Call Agent involvement. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
