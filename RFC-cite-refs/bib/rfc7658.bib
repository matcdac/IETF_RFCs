	abstract =	{This memo deprecates MIB module NAT-MIB, a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) previously defined in RFC 4008 for devices implementing Network Address Translator (NAT) function. A companion document defines a new version, NATV2-MIB, which responds to deficiencies found in module NAT-MIB and adds new capabilities. This document obsoletes RFC 4008. All MIB objects specified in RFC 4008 are included in this version unchanged with only the STATUS changed to deprecated.},
