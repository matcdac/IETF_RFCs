	abstract =	{This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module for configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2). The OLSRv2-MIB module is structured into configuration information, state information, performance information, and notifications. This additional state and performance information is useful for troubleshooting problems and performance issues of the routing protocol. Two levels of compliance allow this MIB module to be deployed on constrained routers.},
