	abstract =	{This document describes an architectural framework we call a processing language, as a simple and standardized way for implementing and deploying Internet telephony. A large number of the services we wish to make possible for Internet telephony require fairly elaborate combinations of signalling operations, often in network devices, to complete. It also outlines requirements for such a language. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
