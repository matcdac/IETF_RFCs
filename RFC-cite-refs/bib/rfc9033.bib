	abstract =	{This specification defines the "IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4" (6TiSCH) Minimal Scheduling Function (MSF). This Scheduling Function describes both the behavior of a node when joining the network and how the communication schedule is managed in a distributed fashion. MSF is built upon the 6TiSCH Operation Sublayer Protocol (6P) and the minimal security framework for 6TiSCH.},
