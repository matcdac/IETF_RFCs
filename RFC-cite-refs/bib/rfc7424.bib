	abstract =	{Demands on networking infrastructure are growing exponentially due to bandwidth-hungry applications such as rich media applications and inter-data-center communications. In this context, it is important to optimally use the bandwidth in wired networks that extensively use link aggregation groups and equal-cost multipaths as techniques for bandwidth scaling. This document explores some of the mechanisms useful for achieving this.},
