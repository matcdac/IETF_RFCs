	abstract =	{In some scenarios, MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) pseudowires (PWs) (RFC 5921) may be statically configured when a dynamic control plane is not available. A fast protection mechanism for MPLS-TP PWs is needed to protect against the failure of an Attachment Circuit (AC), the failure of a Provider Edge (PE), or a failure in the Packet Switched Network (PSN). The framework and typical scenarios of dual- homing PW local protection are described in RFC 8184. This document proposes a dual-homing coordination mechanism for MPLS-TP PWs that is used for state exchange and switchover coordination between the dual- homing PEs for dual-homing PW local protection.},
