	abstract =	{Large Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployments would benefit from a functionality where a Mobile Access Gateway could dynamically discover a Local Mobility Anchor for a Mobile Node attaching to a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain. The purpose of the dynamic discovery functionality is to reduce the amount of static configuration in the Mobile Access Gateway. This document describes several possible dynamic Local Mobility Anchor discovery solutions.
