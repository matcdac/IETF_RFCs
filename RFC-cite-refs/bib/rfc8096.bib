	abstract =	{In 2005-2006, the IPv6 MIB update group published updated versions of the IP-MIB, UDP-MIB, TCP-MIB, and IP-FORWARD-MIB modules, which use the InetAddressType/InetAddress construct to handle IPv4 and IPv6 in the same table. This document contains versions of the obsoleted IPV6-MIB, IPV6-TC, IPV6-ICMP-MIB, IPV6-TCP-MIB, and IPV6-UDP-MIB modules for the purpose of updating MIB module repositories. This document obsoletes RFCs 2452, 2454, 2465, and 2466 (i.e., the RFCs containing these MIBs) and reclassifies them as Historic.},
