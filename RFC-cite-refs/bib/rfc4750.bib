	abstract =	{This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular, it defines objects for managing version 2 of the Open Shortest Path First Routing Protocol. Version 2 of the OSPF protocol is specific to the IPv4 address family. Version 3 of the OSPF protocol is specific to the IPv6 address family. This memo obsoletes RFC 1850; however, it is designed to be backwards compatible. The functional differences between this memo and RFC 1850 are explained in Appendix B. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
