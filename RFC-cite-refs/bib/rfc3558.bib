	abstract =	{This document describes the RTP payload format for Enhanced Variable Rate Codec (EVRC) Speech and Selectable Mode Vocoder (SMV) Speech. Two sub-formats are specified for different application scenarios. A bundled/interleaved format is included to reduce the effect of packet loss on speech quality and amortize the overhead of the RTP header over more than one speech frame. A non-bundled format is also supported for conversational applications. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
