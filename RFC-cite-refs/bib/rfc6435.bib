	abstract =	{Two useful Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) functions in a transport network are "lock" and "loopback". The lock function enables an operator to lock a transport path such that it does not carry client traffic, but can continue to carry OAM messages and may carry test traffic. The loopback function allows an operator to set a specific node on the transport path into loopback mode such that it returns all received data. This document specifies the lock function for MPLS networks and describes how the loopback function operates in MPLS networks. This document updates Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 of RFC 6371. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
