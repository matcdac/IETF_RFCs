	abstract =	{This document adds IPv6 support to Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN). IPv6 support in TURN includes IPv4-to-IPv6, IPv6-to-IPv6, and IPv6-to-IPv4 relaying. This document defines the REQUESTED- ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute for TURN. The REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute allows a client to explicitly request the address type the TURN server will allocate (e.g., an IPv4-only node may request the TURN server to allocate an IPv6 address). {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
