	abstract =	{This document specifies the SIP P-Private-Network-Indication P-header used by the 3GPP. The P-Private-Network-Indication indicates that the message is part of the message traffic of a private network and identifies that private network. A private network indication allows nodes to treat private network traffic according to a different set of rules than the set applicable to public network traffic.},
