	abstract =	{The base Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) includes audit commands that only allow a Call Agent to audit endpoint and/or connection state one endpoint at a time. This document describes a new MGCP package for bulk auditing of a group of gateway endpoints. It allows a Call Agent to determine the endpoint naming convention, the list of instantiated endpoints as well connection and endpoint state for the group of endpoints.},
