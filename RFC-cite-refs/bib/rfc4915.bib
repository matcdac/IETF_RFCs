	abstract =	{This document describes an extension to Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) in order to define independent IP topologies called Multi- Topologies (MTs). The Multi-Topologies extension can be used for computing different paths for unicast traffic, multicast traffic, different classes of service based on flexible criteria, or an in- band network management topology. An optional extension to exclude selected links from the default topology is also described. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
