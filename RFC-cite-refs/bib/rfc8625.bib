	abstract =	{A packet-switching network may contain links with variable bandwidths (e.g., copper and radio). The bandwidth of such links is sensitive to the external environment (e.g., climate). Availability is typically used to describe these links when doing network planning. This document introduces an optional Bandwidth Availability TLV in RSVP-TE signaling. This extension can be used to set up a GMPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) in conjunction with the Ethernet SENDER\_TSPEC object.},
