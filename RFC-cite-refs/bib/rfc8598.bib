	abstract =	{This document defines two Configuration Payload Attribute Types (INTERNAL\_DNS\_DOMAIN and INTERNAL\_DNSSEC\_TA) for the Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2). These payloads add support for private (internal-only) DNS domains. These domains are intended to be resolved using non-public DNS servers that are only reachable through the IPsec connection. DNS resolution for other domains remains unchanged. These Configuration Payloads only apply to split- tunnel configurations.},
