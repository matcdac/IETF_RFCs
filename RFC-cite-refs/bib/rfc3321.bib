	abstract =	{This document describes how to implement certain mechanisms in SigComp (Signaling Compression), RFC XXX, which can significantly improve the compression efficiency compared to using simple per- message compression. SigComp uses a UDVM (Universal Decompressor Virtual Machine) for decompression, and the mechanisms described in this document are possible to implement using the UDVM instructions defined in RFC XXX.},
