	abstract =	{This document describes the architecture of a Suite B compliant implementation of the Secure Shell Transport Layer Protocol and the Secure Shell Authentication Protocol. Suite B Secure Shell makes use of the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement, the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), the Advanced Encryption Standard running in Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM), two members of the SHA-2 family of hashes (SHA-256 and SHA-384), and X.509 certificates. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.},
