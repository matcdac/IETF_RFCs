	abstract =	{This memo updates the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) framework defined by RFC 2330 with new considerations for measurement methodology and testing. It updates the definition of standard-formed packets to include IPv6 packets, deprecates the definition of minimal IP packet, and augments distinguishing aspects, referred to as Type-P, for test packets in RFC 2330. This memo identifies that IPv4-IPv6 coexistence can challenge measurements within the scope of the IPPM framework. Example use cases include, but are not limited to, IPv4-IPv6 translation, NAT, and protocol encapsulation. IPv6 header compression and use of IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Area Networks (6LoWPAN) are considered and excluded from the standard-formed packet evaluation.},
