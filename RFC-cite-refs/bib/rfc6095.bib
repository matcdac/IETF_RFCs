	abstract =	{YANG -- the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Data Modeling Language -- supports modeling of a tree of data elements that represent the configuration and runtime status of a particular network element managed via NETCONF. This memo suggests enhancing YANG with supplementary modeling features and language abstractions with the aim to improve the model extensibility and reuse. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.},
