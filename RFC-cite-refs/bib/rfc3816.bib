	abstract =	{This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that allow monitoring of running instances of RObust Header Compression (ROHC). The managed objects defined in this memo are grouped into three MIB modules. The ROHC-MIB module defines managed objects shared by all ROHC profiles, the ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB module defines managed objects specific to the ROHC uncompressed profile, the ROHC-RTP-MIB module defines managed objects specific to the ROHC RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol) profile, the ROHC UDP (User Datagram Protocol) profile, the ROHC ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) profile, and the ROHC LLA (Link Layer Assisted) profile. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
