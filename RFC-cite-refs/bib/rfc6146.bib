	abstract =	{This document describes stateful NAT64 translation, which allows IPv6-only clients to contact IPv4 servers using unicast UDP, TCP, or ICMP. The public IPv4 address can be shared among several IPv6-only clients. When the stateful NAT64 is used in conjunction with DNS64 no changes are usually required in the IPv6 client or the IPv4 server.},
