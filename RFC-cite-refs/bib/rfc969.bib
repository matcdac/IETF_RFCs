	abstract =	{This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. This is a preliminary discussion of the Network Block Transfer (NETBLT) protocol. NETBLT is intended for the rapid transfer of a large quantity of data between computers. It provides a transfer that is reliable and flow controlled, and is structured to provide maximum throughput over a wide variety of networks. This description is published for discussion and comment, and does not constitute a standard. As the proposal may change, implementation of this document is not advised. See RFC-998.},
