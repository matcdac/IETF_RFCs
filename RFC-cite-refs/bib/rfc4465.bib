	abstract =	{This document provides a set of "torture tests" for implementers of the Signaling Compression (SigComp) protocol. The torture tests check each of the SigComp Universal Decompressor Virtual Machine instructions in turn, focusing in particular on the boundary and error cases that are not generally encountered when running well-behaved compression algorithms. Tests are also provided for other SigComp entities such as the dispatcher and the state handler. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
