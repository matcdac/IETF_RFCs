	abstract =	{This document specifies the syntax and semantics for the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) content constraints extension. This extension is used to determine whether a public key is appropriate to use in the processing of a protected content. In particular, the CMS content constraints extension is one part of the authorization decision; it is used when validating a digital signature on a CMS SignedData content or validating a message authentication code (MAC) on a CMS AuthenticatedData content or CMS AuthEnvelopedData content. The signed or authenticated content type is identified by an ASN.1 object identifier, and this extension indicates the content types that the public key is authorized to validate. If the authorization check is successful, the CMS content constraints extension also provides default values for absent attributes. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
