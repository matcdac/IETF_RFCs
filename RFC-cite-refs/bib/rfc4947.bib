	abstract =	{This document describes the process of binding/associating IPv4/IPv6 addresses with MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). This procedure is known as Address Resolution (AR) or Neighbor Discovery (ND). Such address resolution complements the higher-layer resource discovery tools that are used to advertise IP sessions. In MPEG-2 Networks, an IP address must be associated with a Packet ID (PID) value and a specific Transmission Multiplex. This document reviews current methods appropriate to a range of technologies (such as DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting), ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee), DOCSIS (Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications), and variants). It also describes the interaction with well-known protocols for address management including DHCP, ARP, and the ND protocol. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
