	abstract =	{This memo utilizes IP performance metrics that are applicable to both complete paths and sub-paths, and it defines relationships to compose a complete path metric from the sub-path metrics with some accuracy with regard to the actual metrics. This is called "spatial composition" in RFC 2330. The memo refers to the framework for metric composition, and provides background and motivation for combining metrics to derive others. The descriptions of several composed metrics and statistics follow. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
