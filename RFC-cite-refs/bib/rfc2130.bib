	abstract =	{This report details the conclusions of an IAB-sponsored invitational workshop held 29 February - 1 March, 1996, to discuss the use of character sets on the Internet. It motivates the need to have character set handling in Internet protocols which transmit text, provides a conceptual framework for specifying character sets, recommends the use of MIME tagging for transmitted text, recommends a default character set *without* stating that there is no need for other character sets, and makes a series of recommendations to the IAB, IANA, and the IESG for furthering the integration of the character set framework into text transmission protocols. This memo provides information for the Internet community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.},
