	abstract =	{This specification documents an extension to the Diameter Overload Indication Conveyance (DOIC) base solution, which is defined in RFC 7683. This extension adds a new overload-control abatement algorithm. This abatement algorithm allows for a DOIC reporting node to specify a maximum rate at which a DOIC reacting node sends Diameter requests to the DOIC reporting node.},
