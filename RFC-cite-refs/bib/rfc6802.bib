	abstract =	{This memo describes an extension to the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP). Specifically, it extends the TWAMP-Test protocol, which identifies and manages packet trains, in order to measure capacity metrics like the available path capacity, tight section capacity, and UDP delivery rate in the forward and reverse path directions.
