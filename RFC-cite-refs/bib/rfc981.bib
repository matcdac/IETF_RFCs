	abstract =	{This document introduces wiretap algorithms, a class of experimental, multiple routing algorithms that compute quasi-optimum routes for stations sharing a packet-radio broadcast channel. The primary route (a minimum-distance path), and additional paths ordered by distance, which serve as alternate routes should the primary route fail, are computed. This prototype is presented as an example of a class of routing algorithms and data-base management techniques that may find wider application in the Internet community. Discussions and suggestions for improvements are welcomed.},
