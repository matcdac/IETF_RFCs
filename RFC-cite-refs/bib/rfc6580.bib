	abstract =	{The original RFCs that specified the Remote Direct Data Placement (RDDP) protocol suite did not create IANA registries for RDDP error codes, operation codes, and function codes. Extensions to the RDDP protocols now require these registries to be created. This memo creates the RDDP registries, populates them with values defined in the original RDDP RFCs, and provides guidance to IANA for future assignment of code points within these registries. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
