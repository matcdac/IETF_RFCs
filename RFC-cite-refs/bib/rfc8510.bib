	abstract =	{Every OSPF interface is assigned an Interface ID that uniquely identifies the interface on the router. In some cases, it is useful to know the assigned Interface ID on the remote side of the adjacency (Remote Interface ID). This document describes the extensions to OSPF link-local signaling (LLS) to advertise the Local Interface ID.},
