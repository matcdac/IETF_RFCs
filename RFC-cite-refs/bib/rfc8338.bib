	abstract =	{This document specifies a mechanism to signal Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudowire (PW) trees using LDP. Such a mechanism is suitable for any Layer 2 VPN service requiring P2MP connectivity over an IP or MPLS-enabled PSN. A P2MP PW established via the proposed mechanism is root initiated. This document updates RFC 7385 by reassigning the reserved value 0xFF to be the wildcard transport tunnel type.},
