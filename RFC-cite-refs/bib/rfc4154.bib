	abstract =	{This document specifies the Voucher Trading System Application Programming Interface (VTS-API). The VTS-API allows a wallet or other application to issue, transfer, and redeem vouchers in a uniform manner independent of the VTS implementation. The VTS is a system for securely transferring vouchers; e.g., coupons, tickets, loyalty points, and gift certificates. This process is often necessary in the course of payment and/or delivery transactions. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
