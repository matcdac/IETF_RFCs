The set of standards covers the services and protocols required to achieve such interconnection. This Protocol is positioned with respect to other related standards by the layers defined in the Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection (ISO 7498) and by the structure defined in the Internal Organization of the Network Layer (DIS 8648). In particular, it is a protocol of the Network Layer. This Protocol permits End Systems and Intermediate Systems to exchange configuration and routing information to facilitate the operation of the routing and relaying functions of the Network Layer.},
