	abstract =	{This document specifies a new extension for use by Foreign Agents operating Mobile IP for IPv4. Currently, a foreign agent cannot supply status information without destroying the ability for a mobile node to verify authentication data supplied by the home agent. The new extension solves this problem by making a better place for the foreign agent to provide its status information to the mobile node. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
