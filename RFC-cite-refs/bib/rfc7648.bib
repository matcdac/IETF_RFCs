	abstract =	{This document specifies a new Port Control Protocol (PCP) functional element: the PCP proxy. The PCP proxy relays PCP requests received from PCP clients to upstream PCP server(s). A typical deployment usage of this function is to help establish successful PCP communications for PCP clients that cannot be configured with the address of a PCP server located more than one hop away.},
