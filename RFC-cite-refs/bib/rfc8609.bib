	abstract =	{Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) is a network protocol that uses a hierarchical name to forward requests and to match responses to requests. This document specifies the encoding of CCNx messages in a TLV packet format, including the TLV types used by each message element and the encoding of each value. The semantics of CCNx messages follow the encoding-independent CCNx Semantics specification. This document is a product of the Information Centric Networking research group (ICNRG). The document received wide review among ICNRG participants and has two full implementations currently in active use, which have informed the technical maturity of the protocol specification.},
