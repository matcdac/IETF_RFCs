	abstract =	{This document defines a YANG data model for control and management of radio link interfaces and their connectivity to packet (typically Ethernet) interfaces in a microwave/millimeter wave node. The data nodes for management of the interface protection functionality is broken out into a separate and generic YANG data model in order to make it available for other interface types as well.},
