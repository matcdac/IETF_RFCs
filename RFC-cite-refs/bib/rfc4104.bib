	abstract =	{This document defines a number of changes and extensions to the Policy Core Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Schema (RFC 3703) based on the model extensions defined by the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions (RFC 3460). These changes and extensions consist of new LDAP object classes and attribute types. Some of the schema items defined in this document re-implement existing concepts in accordance with their new semantics introduced by RFC 3460. The other schema items implement new concepts, not covered by RFC 3703. This document updates RFC 3703. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
