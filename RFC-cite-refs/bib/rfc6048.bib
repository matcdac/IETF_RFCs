	abstract =	{This document defines a set of enhancements to the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) that allow a client to request extended information from NNTP servers regarding server status, policy, and other aspects of local configuration. These enhancements are made as new keywords to the existing LIST capability described in RFC 3977. This memo updates and formalizes the LIST DISTRIBUTIONS and LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS commands defined in RFC 2980. It also adds the LIST COUNTS, LIST MODERATORS, and LIST MOTD commands, and specifies additional values returned by the existing LIST ACTIVE command for the status of a newsgroup. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
