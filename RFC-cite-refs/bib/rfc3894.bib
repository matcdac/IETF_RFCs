	abstract =	{The Sieve scripting language allows users to control handling and disposal of their incoming e-mail. By default, an e-mail message that is processed by a Sieve script is saved in the owner's "inbox". Actions such as "fileinto" and "redirect" cancel this default behavior. This document defines a new keyword parameter, ":copy", to be used with the Sieve "fileinto" and "redirect" actions. Adding ":copy" to an action suppresses cancellation of the default "inbox" save. It allows users to add commands to an existing script without changing the meaning of the rest of the script. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
