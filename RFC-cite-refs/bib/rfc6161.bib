	abstract =	{This document describes the conventions for using several Elliptic Curve cryptographic algorithms with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) encrypted key package content type. Specifically, it includes conventions necessary to implement Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) with EnvelopedData and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with SignedData.
