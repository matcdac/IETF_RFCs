	abstract =	{This Internet Draft defines a protocol for backhauling of SS7 MTP2 User signaling messages over IP using the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). This protocol would be used between a Signaling Gateway (SG) and Media Gateway Controller (MGC). It is assumed that the SG receives SS7 signaling over a standard SS7 interface using the SS7 Message Transfer Part (MTP) to provide transport. The Signaling Gateway would act as a Signaling Link Terminal.},
