	abstract =	{This memo describes challenges associated with securing resource- constrained smart object devices. The memo describes a possible deployment model where resource-constrained devices sign message objects, discusses the availability of cryptographic libraries for resource-constrained devices, and presents some preliminary experiences with those libraries for message signing on resource- constrained devices. Lastly, the memo discusses trade-offs involving different types of security approaches.},
