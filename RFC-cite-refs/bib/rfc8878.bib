	abstract =	{Zstandard, or "zstd" (pronounced "zee standard"), is a lossless data compression mechanism. This document describes the mechanism and registers a media type, content encoding, and a structured syntax suffix to be used when transporting zstd-compressed content via MIME. Despite use of the word "standard" as part of Zstandard, readers are advised that this document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is being published for informational purposes only. This document replaces and obsoletes RFC 8478.},
