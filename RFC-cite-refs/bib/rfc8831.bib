	abstract =	{The WebRTC framework specifies protocol support for direct, interactive, rich communication using audio, video, and data between two peers' web browsers.

It provides an architectural overview of how the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is used in the WebRTC context as a generic transport service that allows web browsers to exchange generic data from peer to peer.},
