	abstract =	{This document describes a method for encapsulating structured (NxDS0) Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) signals as pseudowires over packet-switching networks (PSNs). In this regard, it complements similar work for structure-agnostic emulation of TDM bit-streams (see RFC 4553). This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
