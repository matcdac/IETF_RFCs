	abstract =	{This document specifies a standard method of encapsulating 802.2 packets on networks supporting Novell's Internet Packet Exchange Protocol (IPX). It obsoletes earlier documents detailing the transmission of Internet packets over IPX networks. It differs from these earlier documents in that it allows for the transmission of multiple network protocols over IPX and for the transmission of packets through IPX bridges.},
