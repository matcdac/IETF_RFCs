	abstract =	{This document defines a generic framework for preconditions which is extensible through IANA registration. This document also discusses how network quality of service can be made a precondition to establishment of sessions initiated by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). These preconditions require that the participant reserve network resources before continuing with the session. We do not define new quality of service reservation mechanisms; these preconditions simply require a participant to use existing resource reservation mechanisms before beginning the session},
