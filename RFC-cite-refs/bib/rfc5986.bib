	abstract =	{Discovery of the correct Location Information Server (LIS) in the local access network is necessary for Devices that wish to acquire location information from the network. A method is described for the discovery of a LIS in the access network serving a Device. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) options for IP versions 4 and 6 are defined that specify a domain name. This domain name is then used as input to a URI-enabled NAPTR (U-NAPTR) resolution process. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
