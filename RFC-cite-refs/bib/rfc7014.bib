	abstract =	{The Intermediate Flow Selection Process is the process of selecting a subset of Flows from all observed Flows. The Intermediate Flow Selection Process may be located at an IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Exporter or Collector, or within an IPFIX Mediator. It reduces the effort of post-processing Flow data and transferring Flow Records. This document describes motivations for using the Intermediate Flow Selection process and presents Intermediate Flow Selection techniques. It provides an information model for configuring Intermediate Flow Selection Process techniques and discusses what information about an Intermediate Flow Selection Process should be exported.},
