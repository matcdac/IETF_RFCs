	abstract =	{The Multicast Ping Protocol specified in this document allows for checking whether an endpoint can receive multicast -- both Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) and Any-Source Multicast (ASM). It can also be used to obtain additional multicast-related information, such as multicast tree setup time. This protocol is based on an implementation of tools called "ssmping" and "asmping". {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
