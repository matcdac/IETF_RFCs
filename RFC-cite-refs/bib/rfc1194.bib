	abstract =	{This memo describes the Finger User Information Protocol. This is a simple protocol which provides an interface to a remote user information program. Based on RFC 742, a description of the original Finger protocol, this memo attempts to clarify the expected communication between the two ends of a Finger connection. It also tries not to invalidate the many existing implementations or add unnecessary restrictions to the original protocol definition. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
