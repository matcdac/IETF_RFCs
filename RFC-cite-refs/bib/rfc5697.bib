	abstract =	{Some applications that associate state information with public key certificates can benefit from a way to link together a set of certificates that belong to the same end entity and that can safely be considered equivalent to one another for the purposes of referencing that application-state information.

This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.},
