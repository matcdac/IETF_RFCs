Held under the suspices of the Internet Activities Board at the request of the FRICC, and sponsored by NASA through RIACS, the workshops addressed the required and feasible technologies and architectures that could be used to satisfy the desired policies for interconnection. The purpose of this RFC is to report the results of these workshops.},
