	abstract =	{This memo defines additional (to those in RFC 2896) protocol identifier examples for IP version 6 and MPLS protocols. These can be used to produce valid protocolDirTable {}`{}`INDEX{}`{}` encodings, as defined by the Remote Network Monitoring MIB (Management Information Base) Version 2 {[}RFC2021{]} and the RMON Protocol Identifier Reference {[}RFC2895{]}. This document contains additional (to those in RFC 2896) protocol identifier macros for well-known protocols. A conformant implementation of the RMON-2 MIB {[}RFC2021{]} can be accomplished without the use of these protocol identifiers, and accordingly, this document does not specify any IETF standard. It is published to encourage better interoperability between RMON-2 agent implementations, by providing RMON related IPv6 and MPLS protocol information. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
