Although this memo defines only the use of the multipart/report media type with respect to delivery status reports, mail processing programs will benefit if a single media type is used for all kinds of reports. This memo obsoletes "The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages", RFC 3462, and marks RFC 3462 and its predecessor as "Historic". {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
