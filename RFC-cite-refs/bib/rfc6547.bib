	abstract =	{This document moves "Use of /127 Prefix Length Between Routers Considered Harmful" (RFC 3627) to Historic status to reflect the updated guidance contained in "Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on Inter- Router Links" (RFC 6164). A Standards Track document supersedes an informational document; therefore, guidance provided in RFC 6164 is to be followed when the two documents are in conflict. This document links the two RFCs so that the IETF's updated guidance on this topic is clearer. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.},
