	abstract =	{This document defines a protocol supporting the transport of Signaling System Number 7 (SS7) Message Transfer Part (MTP) Level 3 signaling messages over Internet Protocol (IP) using the services of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). This protocol would be used between SS7 Signaling Points using the MTP Level 3 protocol. The SS7 Signaling Points may also use standard SS7 links using the SS7 MTP Level 2 to provide transport of MTP Level 3 signaling messages. The protocol operates in a manner similar to MTP Level 2 so as to provide peer-to-peer communication between SS7 endpoints. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
