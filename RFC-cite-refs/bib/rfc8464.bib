	abstract =	{This document defines a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for the Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) and a Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID). The structure of an MEID is 15 hexadecimal digits long and is defined in the 3GPP2 to uniquely identify each individual mobile equipment (e.g., a handset or mobile phone). The 3GPP2 has a requirement to be able to use an MEID as a URN. This document fulfills that requirement.},
