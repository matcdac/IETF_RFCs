	abstract =	{The Path Computation Element (PCE) may be used for computing services that traverse multi-area and multi-Autonomous System (multi-AS) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic-Engineered (TE) networks. This document examines the applicability of the PCE architecture, protocols, and protocol extensions for computing multi-area and multi-AS paths in MPLS and GMPLS networks.},
