	abstract =	{This document describes an RTP payload format for the Reduced- Complexity Decoding Operation (RCDO) for H.264 Baseline profile bitstreams, as specified in ITU-T Recommendation H.241. RCDO reduces the decoding cost and resource consumption of the video processing. The RCDO RTP payload format is based on the H.264 RTP payload format. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
