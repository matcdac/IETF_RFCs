	abstract =	{RANGER is an architectural framework for scalable routing and addressing in networks with global enterprise recursion. The term "enterprise network" within this context extends to a wide variety of use cases and deployment scenarios, where an "enterprise" can be as small as a Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) network, as dynamic as a Mobile Ad Hoc Network, as complex as a multi-organizational corporation, or as large as the global Internet itself. Such networks will require an architected solution for the coordination of routing and addressing plans with accommodations for scalability, provider-independence, mobility, multihoming, and security. These considerations are particularly true for existing deployments, but the same principles apply even for clean-slate approaches. The RANGER architecture addresses these requirements and provides a comprehensive framework for IPv6/IPv4 coexistence. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.},
