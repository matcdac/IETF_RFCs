	abstract =	{The Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) specifies a Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA) interface type for the transmission of IPv6 packets over IPv4 networks using automatic IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation. The original specifications make no provisions for the encapsulation and transmission of IPv4 packets, however. This document specifies a method for transmitting IPv4 packets over ISATAP interfaces. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.},
