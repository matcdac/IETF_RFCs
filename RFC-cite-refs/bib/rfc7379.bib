	abstract =	{The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol provides support for flow-level multipathing with rapid failover for both unicast and multi-destination traffic in networks with arbitrary topology. Active-active connection at the TRILL edge is the extension of these characteristics to end stations that are multiply connected to a TRILL campus. This informational document discusses the high-level problems and goals when providing active-active connection at the TRILL edge.},
