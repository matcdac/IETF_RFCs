	abstract =	{This document describes a general and flexible TLV (type-length-value structure) for representing time-values, such as an interval or a duration, using the generalized Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) packet/ message format. It defines two Message TLVs and two Address Block TLVs for representing validity and interval times for MANET routing protocols. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
