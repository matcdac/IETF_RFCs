	abstract =	{This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. This document defines an extension to the Interfaces Group MIB with a set of common objects for managing multi-pair bonded Digital Subscriber Line (xDSL) interfaces, as defined in ITU-T Recommendations G.998.1, G.998.2, and G.998.3. The textual conventions defining the bonding schemes are contained in a separate MIB module maintained by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The MIB modules specific to each bonding technology are defined in G9981-MIB, G9982-MIB, and G9983-MIB, respectively.},
