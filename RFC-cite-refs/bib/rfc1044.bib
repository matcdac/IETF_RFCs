This document is directed toward network planners and implementors who are already familiar with the TCP/IP protocol suite and the techniques used to carry TCP/IP traffic on common networks such as the DDN or the Ethernet. No great familiarity with NSC products is assumed; an appendix is devoted to a review of NSC technologies and protocols.},
