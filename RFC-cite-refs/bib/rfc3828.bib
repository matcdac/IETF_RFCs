	abstract =	{This document describes the Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite), which is similar to the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) (RFC 768), but can also serve applications in error-prone network environments that prefer to have partially damaged payloads delivered rather than discarded. If this feature is not used, UDP-Lite is semantically identical to UDP. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
