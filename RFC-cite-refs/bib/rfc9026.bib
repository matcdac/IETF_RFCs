	abstract =	{This document defines Multicast Virtual Private Network (VPN) extensions and procedures that allow fast failover for upstream failures by allowing downstream Provider Edges (PEs) to consider the status of Provider-Tunnels (P-tunnels) when selecting the Upstream PE for a VPN multicast flow. The fast failover is enabled by using "Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for Multipoint Networks" (RFC 8562) and the new BGP Attribute, BFD Discriminator. Also, this document introduces a new BGP Community, Standby PE, extending BGP Multicast VPN (MVPN) routing so that a C-multicast route can be advertised toward a Standby Upstream PE.},
