	abstract =	{This memo describes SIV (Synthetic Initialization Vector), a block cipher mode of operation. SIV takes a key, a plaintext, and multiple variable-length octet strings that will be authenticated but not encrypted. It produces a ciphertext having the same length as the plaintext and a synthetic initialization vector. Depending on how it is used, SIV achieves either the goal of deterministic authenticated encryption or the goal of nonce-based, misuse-resistant authenticated encryption. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},
