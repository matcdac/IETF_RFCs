	abstract =	{The IP Storage Working group is chartered with developing comprehensive technology to transport block storage data over IP protocols. This effort includes a protocol to transport the Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) protocol over the Internet (iSCSI). The initial version of the iSCSI protocol will define a mapping of SCSI transport protocol over TCP/IP so that SCSI storage controllers (principally disk and tape arrays and libraries) can be attached to IP networks, notably Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) and 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10 GbE).},
