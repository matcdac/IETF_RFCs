	abstract =	{The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) specification defined two stateful options, IA\_NA and IA\_TA, but did not anticipate the development of additional stateful options. DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation added the IA\_PD option, which is stateful. Applications that use IA\_NA and IA\_PD together have revealed issues that need to be addressed. This document updates RFCs 3315 and 3633 to address these issues.},
